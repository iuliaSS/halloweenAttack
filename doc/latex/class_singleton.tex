Be aware this will not prevent a non singleton constructor such as {\ttfamily T myT = new T();} To prevent that, add {\ttfamily protected T () \{\}} to your singleton class.

When Unity quits, it destroys objects in a random order. In principle, a \hyperlink{class_singleton}{Singleton} is only destroyed when application quits. If any script calls Instance after it have been destroyed, it will create a buggy ghost object that will stay on the Editor scene even after stopping playing the Application. Really bad! So, this was made to be sure we\textquotesingle{}re not creating that buggy ghost object.
